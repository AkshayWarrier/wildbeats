# wildbeats
Our goal with the cultural website is to highlight the cultural diversity of our country and then show how wildbeats is trying to celebrate that.   The website will be static and will consist of a landing page, a menu, cultural clubâ€™s mission, and a gallery with events and festivals. It will also contain subpages for art, dance, music and drama. Each of these subpages will have a description. We will also implement an embedded streaming service for music concerts. We will include the contact information of current mentors, club leads and previous mentors. Finally we will add a chat button which will be an easy contact tab with a text box that can be filled and that will send a message to the wildbeats mail.
